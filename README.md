# Coalescence Microseismic Scanning (CMS): Earthquake Onset Detection and Location Method

Blah Blah, describe software.


## Software Background and Methods 
### CMSLut - Travel-Time look-up table generation and definition

### CMSMseed - Definition of continious seismic data strcture for MSEED data

### CMScan - Detection and Location of events.



## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

### Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system



## Built With

* [ObsPy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki) - Python framework for processing seismological data
* [scikit-fmm](https://pythonhosted.org/scikit-fmm/) - Python extension module which implements the fast marching method
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) - NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
